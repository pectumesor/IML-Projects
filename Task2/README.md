Project 2: Data Imputing, Encoding and Kernels

We needed to learn a model to predict the housing price in Switzerland, using
data from other countries in Europe. However, our training data set had missing data and some data was not numerical. Thus, we needed to do the following:
<br>
1. Impute the missing data.
2. Enconde non-numerical data.

Once that was done, we chose our learning model to be a Gaussian Process Regressor
using a Matern Kernel.
