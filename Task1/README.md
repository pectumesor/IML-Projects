Project 1: Ridge Regression

1.a) We were tasked with performing a ridge regression on data and doing a 10-fold cross validation.
We needed to save the RMSE for each lambda we used in a matrix.

1.b) Perform a non-linear mapping on the data and then perform a
cross-validated Ridge Regression in order to learn non-linear features.
We had to submit our learned weight vector.
